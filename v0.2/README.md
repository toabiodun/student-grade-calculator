📘 Student Grade Calculator – Version v0.2

Version v0.2 is a refactored and extended upgrade of the original Student Grade Calculator. This release focuses on improved code structure, exception handling, and high-performance testing using std::vector on large datasets.

✨ What Is New in v0.2

Compared to v0.1, this version introduces:
• Cleaner, modular project structure (.h and .cpp separated)
• Exception handling for invalid files and inputs
• Automatic generation of large random datasets
• Performance benchmarking using std::vector
• Splitting students into Passed and Failed categories
• Writing results into dataset-specific output files

📁 Project Structure (v0.2 Folder)

The v0.2 directory contains:
main.cpp
Person.cpp
Person.h
README.md

During performance testing, the following files are automatically generated:
students_1000_passed_vector.txt
students_1000_failed_vector.txt
students_10000_passed_vector.txt
students_10000_failed_vector.txt
students_100000_passed_vector.txt
students_100000_failed_vector.txt
students_1000000_passed_vector.txt
students_1000000_failed_vector.txt

These files store the passed and failed students for each dataset size.

⚙️ How the Program Works in v0.2

The user starts the program and sees the main menu.

Choosing Option 4 runs the vector performance test.

The program generates datasets of sizes:
• 1,000
• 10,000
• 100,000
• 1,000,000

For each dataset, the program:
• Generates random names (Name1 Surname1, …)
• Generates random homework + exam scores (1–10)
• Computes final grade using:
FinalGrade = 0.4 * average(hw) + 0.6 * exam
• Sorts students
• Splits into:
– Passed (Final >= 5.0)
– Failed (Final < 5.0)
• Writes results into:
students_N_passed_vector.txt
students_N_failed_vector.txt
• Measures timing for:
– Generation
– Sorting
– Splitting
– Writing

⚠️ Large Dataset Notice

The file students_1000000_passed_vector.txt exceeds GitHub’s 25MB upload limit.
It is included only in the ZIP submitted to Moodle, as required by the assignment.
All datasets were successfully generated by the program during testing.

🛡 Exception Handling in v0.2

This version uses try/catch blocks to prevent crashes and improve reliability:
• File-open failures produce clear error messages
• Malformed data lines are skipped or handled safely
• Vector operations avoid out-of-range access
• User input is validated

🔧 Compilation (v0.2)

Compile using g++:
g++ -std=c++11 -O2 -o student_grading_v02 main.cpp Person.cpp

▶️ Running the Program

In Windows PowerShell (inside the v0.2 folder):
.\student_grading_v02.exe
Select option 4 to run the performance benchmark.

📌 Version Relationships

• v0.1 – manual/file input, average/median, base logic
• v0.2 – refactoring, exceptions, vector performance tests
• v0.25 – same as v0.2 but implemented using std::list and std::deque
