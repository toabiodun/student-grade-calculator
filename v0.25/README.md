🎓 Student Grade Calculator – Version v0.25

Version v0.25 extends the project from v0.1 and v0.2 and focuses on performance comparison of three C++ containers:

std::vector (implemented in v0.2)

std::list

std::deque

The goal is to see how fast different containers can:

generate large student datasets

sort students

split them into passed and failed groups

write results into text files

This version implements the same logic as v0.2 but using list and deque, as required in the assignment.

✨ What Is New in v0.25?

Compared to v0.2, this version adds:

✅ Performance tests using std::list<Person>

✅ Performance tests using std::deque<Person>

✅ Shared helper functions for generating, sorting, splitting and writing

✅ Timing of each step with std::chrono

✅ Separate output files for each container and dataset size

Example output file names:

students_1000_passed_list.txt

students_1000_failed_list.txt

students_1000_passed_deque.txt

students_1000_failed_deque.txt

📂 Project Structure (v0.25 Folder)

Files inside the v0.25 folder:

main.cpp – performance tests for list and deque

Person.cpp – implementation of Person class (same as v0.2)

Person.h – definition of Person class (same as v0.2)

README.md – this documentation for version v0.25

The Person class still includes:

rule of three (copy constructor, assignment operator, destructor)

homework and exam scores

final grade calculation (average and median)

comparison operator for sorting

🧠 How the Program Works in v0.25

The program starts and shows a menu:

1 – run performance test using std::list

2 – run performance test using std::deque

After the choice, the program automatically generates datasets with sizes:

1000 students

10 000 students

100 000 students

For each dataset size N it:

creates students with names like Name1 Surname1, Name2 Surname2, …

generates random homework and exam scores in the range 1–10

calculates the final grade using the average formula

FinalGrade = 0.4 × Average(Homework) + 0.6 × Exam

sorts the container (list or deque) by surname and name

splits students into two groups:

passed – final grade ≥ 5.0

failed – final grade < 5.0

writes the results into two text files:

students_N_passed_list.txt or students_N_passed_deque.txt

students_N_failed_list.txt or students_N_failed_deque.txt

measures how long each step takes:

generation

sorting

splitting

writing

The timings and counts are printed to the console so they can be compared with the vector results from v0.2.

📊 Example Performance Output (short)

Example from a real run (numbers will be different on another computer):

For std::list

1000 students → Generate 3 ms, Sort 1 ms, Split 0 ms, Write 2 ms

10 000 students → Generate 24 ms, Sort 9 ms, Split 1 ms, Write 10 ms

For std::deque

1000 students → Generate 2 ms, Sort 0 ms, Split 0 ms, Write 2 ms

10 000 students → Generate 19 ms, Sort 6 ms, Split 1 ms, Write 9 ms

These results can be compared with the vector timings reported in the v0.2 README.

🛡️ Exception Handling and Safety

Version v0.25 keeps the same safe design used in v0.2:

The Person class follows the rule of three, so copying objects is safe.

Data is generated by the program, so there are no malformed external lines.

Containers are used carefully to avoid out-of-range access.

If file writing fails, the program reports an error message instead of crashing.

🧪 Compilation and Running

Compile (inside v0.25 folder):

g++ -std=c++11 -O2 -o student_grading_v025 main.cpp Person.cpp

Run (Windows PowerShell, inside v0.25 folder):

.\student_grading_v025.exe

Then choose:

1 – run tests using std::list

2 – run tests using std::deque

The program will generate the datasets, print timing information and create all output files.

📁 Output Files Created

For each dataset size (1000, 10 000, 100 000) and for each container type, the program creates:

For std::list

students_1000_passed_list.txt

students_1000_failed_list.txt

students_10000_passed_list.txt

students_10000_failed_list.txt

students_100000_passed_list.txt

students_100000_failed_list.txt

For std::deque

students_1000_passed_deque.txt

students_1000_failed_deque.txt

students_10000_passed_deque.txt

students_10000_failed_deque.txt

students_100000_passed_deque.txt

students_100000_failed_deque.txt

All of these files are included in the ZIP archive that is uploaded to Moodle, so the lecturer can check the results.
