Student Grade Calculator – Version v1.0

Final Release – Strategy Comparison and Performance Analysis

Version v1.0 is the optimized release of the Student Grade Calculator.
This version benchmarks two splitting strategies (Strategy 1 and Strategy 2) across
three standard containers: std::vector, std::list, and std::deque.

Earlier versions:

v0.1 – Basic program, console input, average and median

v0.2 – Performance version using std::vector

v0.25 – Added std::list and std::deque

v1.0 – Final performance comparison using Strategy 1 and Strategy 2

1. Features Implemented in v1.0
Strategy 1: Copy to Passed + Failed

The original container remains unchanged.

Two new containers are created:

passed

failed

Uses std::copy_if.

Faster and simpler.

Requires more memory because two additional containers are created.

Strategy 2: Move Failed + Shrink Base

The base container ends up containing only passed students.

Failed students are moved into a separate failed container.

Uses std::stable_partition and std::move.

More memory efficient.

Sometimes slower, especially for linked structures (std::list).

2. Technologies Used

C++11 standard

std::vector, std::list, std::deque

<algorithm> (copy_if, stable_partition, move)

<chrono> for timing

Makefile and CMakeLists.txt

3. Performance Results (Actual Output)

Below are the exact results generated by the program.

A. std::vector<Person>
N	Generate	Strategy 1	Strategy 2	Passed	Failed
1000	0 ms	0 ms	0 ms	575	425
10000	4 ms	2 ms	2 ms	5908	4092
100000	43 ms	33 ms	52 ms	58463	41537

Interpretation:

Vector is consistently fast.

Strategy 1 is faster for large datasets.

Strategy 2 becomes slower because of element movements.

B. std::list<Person>
N	Generate	Strategy 1	Strategy 2	Passed	Failed
1000	0 ms	0 ms	0 ms	573	427
10000	5 ms	1 ms	2 ms	5873	4127
100000	46 ms	28 ms	52 ms	58594	41406

Interpretation:

List generation is slower due to node allocation.

Strategy 1 is clearly faster.

Strategy 2 becomes slow because moving list nodes is costly.

C. std::deque<Person>
N	Generate	Strategy 1	Strategy 2	Passed	Failed
1000	0 ms	0 ms	0 ms	601	399
10000	9 ms	2 ms	6 ms	5877	4123
100000	80 ms	33 ms	28 ms	58223	41777

Interpretation:

Deque has the slowest generation time.

Strategy 1 and Strategy 2 are close in speed.

Vector still outperforms deque for large datasets.

4. Final Conclusions
Best Container: std::vector<Person>

Fastest generation

Best CPU cache locality

Best Strategy 1 performance

Best Strategy: Strategy 1 (Copy)

More stable and predictable

Faster in vector and list

Easier to understand and implement

Recommended Combination

Vector + Strategy 1
This provides the highest performance and simplest memory model.
